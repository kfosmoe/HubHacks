These files are used in the data analysis and for creating JSON files that are easy to read into the D3.js libraries.

The general method for using these files are:

1. Use the Stops to Town/Ward classifier files to make an augmented stop csv file
2. Use the adj (adjacency matrix) constructor files to construct the adjacency matrix.
3. Use the JSON constructor files to create a file that can be used with the D3.js libraries to create network visulaizations.
